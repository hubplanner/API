#### Pagination

Most of the above areas can be paginated using url parameters `limit` and `page`. By default the limit is `0`, which means unlimited. In the future unlimited
listings will be disabled and the results will need to be paginated, so we suggest adding support for pagination as soon as possible.

The example call to make use of pagination looks like this:

```
GET /project?page=0&limit=20
```
Which will paginate endpoint with 20 results per page. Pages start numbering with `0`. If you want to get all results you should loop trough pages until
you reach page with less than requested amount of elements(in this example less than 20).

The endpoints that can be paginated in most areas are `GET /areaName` and `POST /areaName/search`.

#### Sorting results

Most of the endpoints can be sorted ascending or descending based on some of the properties. Documentation for each area you have access to lists sortable
fields in the property table. Results can be sorted for `GET /areaName` and `POST /areaName/search` requests.

To sort the data add `sort` parameter to the url, followed by field you want to sort by. Prefix the property with minus sign(`-`) to sort in descending order.
For example:

```
GET /projectGroup?sort=-name
```

Will sort the project groups in descending order based on their names.

You can chain multiple sort arguments to create more advanced sort results. For example:

```
GET /projectGroup?sort=-groupType&sort=name
```

Will first sort project groups by their group types in descending order, then sort each group type alphabetically by name. Sample response(with unnecessary
properties ommited):

```
[
   {
      "name":"Eric's Projects",
      "groupType":"USER",
   },
   {
      "name":"Greg's Projects",
      "groupType":"USER",
   },
   {
      "name":"Rudolf's Projects",
      "groupType":"USER",
   },
   {
      "name":"Active Projects",
      "groupType":"SYSTEM",
   },
   {
      "name":"Archived Projects",
      "groupType":"SYSTEM",
   },
   {
      "name":"Events",
      "groupType":"SYSTEM",
   },
   {
      "name":"Floating projects",
      "groupType":"SYSTEM",
   },
   {
      "name":"Pending projects",
      "groupType":"SYSTEM",
   },
   {
      "name":"Planned projects",
      "groupType":"SYSTEM",
   }
]
```

It's suggested that you use sort argument along with pagination.
